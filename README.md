# VBA_Challenge

##Project Overview

  ###The purpose and background of this project was to determine if refactoring makes the code run faster. In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in the module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

**Results

  ###In this project, we reviewed the run time for All Stocks Analysis for the year 2017 and 2018, see images below.

   ###Based on the image above the refactoring process took a long time. this meant that it took a long time to arrive on answers of the 2017 stock analysis.

  ###This outcomes showed no relationship with the amount of successful, Failed and Canceled
  
  ###We also reviewed the outcomes based on goals and based on the chart, you based on the outcome, you could see a relationship there.

**Summary

##What are the advantage and disadvantages of refactoring?

##Adjantages: The loop runs faster and you are able to acheieve this goal.
## Disadvantages: The 

##What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Based on the chart, there seem to be a level of relationship.

##What are some limitations of this dataset? The criteria could have been different and the ranges was to broad.

##What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? percentage canceled added no value to the data needed, this should have been skipped. The chart did use the specific data criteria during the chart trend.
