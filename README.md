# VBA_Challenge

##Project Overview

  ###The purpose and background of this project was to determine if refactoring makes the code run faster. In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in the module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

**Results

  ###In this project, we reviewed the run time for All Stocks Analysis for the year 2017 and 2018, see images below.

  ###This outcomes showed no relationship with the amount of successful, Failed and Canceled
  
  ###The image below showed the refactoring worked because the amount of time it took was significantly less.
