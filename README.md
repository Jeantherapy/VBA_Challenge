# VBA_Challenge

##Project Overview

  ###The purpose and background of this project was to determine if refactoring makes the code run faster. In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in the module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

**Results

  ###In this project, we reviewed the run time for All Stocks Analysis for the year 2017 and 2018, see images below.

   ###Some of the challenges encountered during this analysis inlcudes ensuring the row labels are changed to display the months of the year, and the       campaign outcomes are sorted in descending order, i had some diffculty createing the line chart is created and ensuring i show the number of successful,  failed, canceled projects by month and the title.

  ###This outcomes showed no relationship with the amount of successful, Failed and Canceled

  ###We also reviewed the outcomes based on goals and based on the chart, you would see a relationship

**Results

##What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date? based on the chart, i do not believe there is a relationship, each outcome was significantly didfferent.

##What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Based on the chart, there seem to be a level of relationship.

##What are some limitations of this dataset? The criteria could have been different and the ranges was to broad.

##What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? percentage canceled added no value to the data needed, this should have been skipped. The chart did use the specific data criteria during the chart trend.
